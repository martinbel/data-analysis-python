Knowing the python ecosystem for data analysis is a key skill to have for Data Analysis, Data Scientists and Data Engineers.
You need to know Pandas, data visualization, statistics and machine learning well to be effective. 
In this series I'll work on concrete use cases and try to teach all these tools and concepts as I solve problems. 
The series are targeted to intermediate/advanced users but I explain everything line by line. 
You should know how to install packages and have some Python experience.
